# Story 0.1: Initialize Next.js Project & Version Control

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a Developer
- I want to initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and set up Git version control
- so that we have a clean, modern frontend boilerplate and can track all code changes effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A new Next.js project is created using the latest stable version (or version specified by tech lead).
2.  The project is configured to use TypeScript.
3.  The Next.js App Router is selected/enabled.
4.  ESLint and Prettier are configured for code linting and formatting (can use Next.js defaults initially).
5.  A local Git repository is initialized in the project root.
6.  A `.gitignore` file is present and configured with appropriate ignores for Next.js, Node.js, and OS-specific files.
7.  An initial commit is made to the local Git repository.
8.  (Optional but recommended) A remote Git repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab) is created and the local repository is pushed to it.

## Tasks / Subtasks

**Development Setup:**
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3): Create a new Next.js application.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Run `npx create-next-app@latest` (or similar command).
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Select TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS (can be re-confirmed in Story 1.9), App Router during setup prompts if available, or configure manually.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 4): Verify or set up basic ESLint and Prettier configuration.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Ensure relevant `devDependencies` are in `package.json`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Add basic `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc.json` if not auto-generated to satisfaction.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 5, 6, 7): Initialize Git and make the first commit.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Run `git init`.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Create or verify `.gitignore` file (e.g., from `create-next-app` or a standard template).
    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Run `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial commit: Setup Next.js project"`.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 8, Optional): Set up remote repository.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Create a new repository on the chosen Git hosting service.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Add the remote origin (`git remote add origin <url>`).
    - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Push the initial commit (`git push -u origin main` or `master`).

## Dev Technical Guidance

- Follow official Next.js documentation for project creation.
- Use a standard `.gitignore` template for Node/Next.js projects.
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is included during `create-next-app` if prompted, as Story 1.9 will build upon it. If not, Story 1.9 Task 1.1 will cover its installation.
