# Builder Games MVP â€“ Frontend Architecture

## Introduction
This document defines the frontend architecture for the Builder Games MVP, translating the PRD's vision into a clear, actionable plan for UI/UX, component structure, and technical stack. It is designed for seamless handoff to engineering and architecture teams, and to guide implementation in alignment with the "Kinetic UI/UX" and HUD-like design goals.

## Theming, Color System, and Kinetic UI

- **Dual-Mode Support:**
  - All UI components must support both dark and light modes, as visually defined in the design system. The default should be dark mode, but users can toggle between modes.

- **Color System:**
  - Use the following color tokens for UI elements, as established in the PRD and design system:
    - **Primary:** Pink
    - **Progression:** Purple
    - **Live/Chaos:** Red
    - **Success:** Green
    - **Discovery:** Blue
    - **Momentum:** Orange
  - These colors should be consistently applied to badges, buttons, alerts, and other key UI elements for clear status and narrative signaling.

- **Pulse Animations:**
  - Use pulse animations for attention-grabbing UI elements (e.g., active build modes, notifications, or key call-to-action areas) to reinforce the "kinetic" and action-forward experience.
