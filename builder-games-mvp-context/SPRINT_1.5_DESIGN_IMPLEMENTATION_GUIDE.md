## üéØ Sprint Goal
Transform Builder Games from functional MVP to compelling product experience by implementing the complete design system, kinetic UI/UX, and brand identity defined in the PRD.

## üìä Strategic Context
- **Foundation**: Sprint 1 delivered solid technical foundation (auth, profiles, posts, feeds)
- **Market Reality**: Users judge products within 50ms - UI is our differentiator
- **Value Prop**: "Show up, ship live, prove it" requires kinetic, action-forward energy
- **Timing**: Perfect moment before notifications and gamification features
